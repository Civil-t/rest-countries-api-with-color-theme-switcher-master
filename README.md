## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla Javascript
- HTML

### What I learned

- HTML DOM and elements manipulation using Javascript
- Use of EventListeners eg change(for input), click, keyup
- Getting elements by class, Id or value
- Using fetch function and use of localStorage(setItem and getItem) to use the data outside the fetch function
- Filtering Data
- Dynamic updating of components

### Continued development

Thinking in terms of scalability prior to starting the project regardless of project size e.g (should have made use of one dynamic card instead of 8 in html)

## Improvements

- Unfinished detailed (dark mode text color)
- Html card elements can be rendered dynamically
- Then display all countries in the API
- View in detail searched country when clicked
- Click on border countries
